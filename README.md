# StarmerAsAService

## What is this?

A REST API which exposes pics of Keir Starmer in various emotional states.

## Why did you build this?

Excellent question.

## How do I use it?

Just go to `<API_ROOT>/keith?emotion={happy|sad|surprise|neutral|angry|}`

Example is hosted at `https://starmer-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/keith?emotion=happy`

## How did you classify your Keiths?

I used [FER](https://pypi.org/project/fer/).

## What license does this have?

GPLv3 for the code, pics are not owned by me and therefore can't be relicensed.
